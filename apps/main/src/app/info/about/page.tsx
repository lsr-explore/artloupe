					Welcome to ArtLoupe â€“ an AI-powered platform for exploring and
					analyzing visual art and photography. Our mission is to empower
					everyone from casual viewers to dedicated artists and historians to
					discover insights hidden within visual works.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					By combining publicly available datasets, computer vision models, and
					user-friendly tools, we make it easier to study composition, color,
					symbolism, and more. Whether you&apos;re an art lover, a student, or a
					creative professional, we hope ArtLoupe enhances your experience of
					visual storytelling.
				</p>
				<p>
					This project is currently under development. We welcome feedback and
					suggestions as we continue building!
